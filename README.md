# Smart Hospital Navigation & Wayfinding System 🏥

A multi-building hospital indoor navigation system built with **React + TypeScript**, using **Leaflet.js** and **SVG-based floor maps**. Implements **A\*** pathfinding on graph-structured JSON data to compute accurate and accessibility-aware routes.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive hospital floor maps using **Leaflet.js** and **SVG**
- **A\*** pathfinding on graph-based map data
- Support for multi-building navigation (buildings, floors, corridors, rooms)
- Planned accessibility-aware routing (elevators, ramps, etc.)
- Planned **Flask + PostgreSQL** backend for map and route storage

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Leaflet.js, SVG
- **Algorithms & Data:** A* Algorithm, Graph Structures, JSON
- **Backend (planned):** Flask, PostgreSQL

## 📂 Project Status

- [ ] Define data model for nodes, edges, and buildings
- [ ] Render SVG floor maps in Leaflet
- [ ] Implement A* pathfinding over graph data
- [ ] Visualize routes on the map
- [ ] Design and build Flask + PostgreSQL API
- [ ] Add basic tests and documentation

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Graph modeling for indoor maps
- A* pathfinding and heuristics
- Frontend–backend separation and API design
- Clean project structure and documentation
